Hereâ€™s the updated MySQL timetable with more specific areas of focus and added practice sessions:

---

### **Week 1: Introduction & Fundamentals with Practice**
**Day 1:** Introduction to Databases  
- **Focus:** Database overview, relational vs. non-relational databases, understanding RDBMS

**Day 2-3:** MySQL Installation & Configuration  
- **Focus:** MySQL CLI vs. MySQL Workbench, secure installation, creating a sample database

**Day 4:** SQL Basics  
- **Practice:** Write basic SQL queries for sample data (mock user and product tables)

**Day 5:** Creating & Managing Databases  
- **Practice:** Create a database for an e-commerce scenario (e.g., `shop_db`) and experiment with different table structures

**Day 6-7:** Creating & Managing Tables  
- **Practice:** Create tables for `customers`, `orders`, `products`, `categories`, setting constraints; simulate basic data entry

---

### **Week 2: CRUD Operations & Querying Data with Focus on Best Practices**
**Day 1-2:** CRUD Operations  
- **Focus:** Understanding CRUD best practices, avoiding data duplication, adhering to normalization
- **Practice:** Add, update, and delete data in `shop_db`; focus on practical examples, like customer details and product info updates

**Day 3:** Filtering Data with WHERE  
- **Practice:** Query based on conditions like customer location, product category, or price range

**Day 4:** Sorting & Limiting Data  
- **Practice:** Sort data by date or price, limit results for pagination purposes, and create custom sorting orders

**Day 5:** Grouping Data & Aggregation  
- **Practice:** Group orders by customer and calculate totals, group products by category and count them

**Day 6-7:** Conditional Expressions  
- **Practice:** Use `CASE` for conditional pricing (e.g., discounts for certain customers), `IFNULL` for handling missing data in joins

---

### **Week 3: Advanced Querying with Real-World Scenarios**
**Day 1-2:** Joins  
- **Focus:** Best practices for joins, performance considerations
- **Practice:** Implement multiple joins in `shop_db` (e.g., join `orders` with `customers` and `products`), create complex join queries

**Day 3:** Subqueries  
- **Practice:** Use subqueries to filter by top purchases or recent orders, create a nested query to get total purchases per customer

**Day 4:** Union & Set Operations  
- **Practice:** Use `UNION` to combine different datasets (e.g., all past vs. recent customer orders)

**Day 5:** Indexing & Performance  
- **Practice:** Experiment with indexing strategies on frequently queried columns (e.g., `product_id`, `order_date`), use `EXPLAIN` to check performance impact

**Day 6-7:** Views & Stored Queries  
- **Practice:** Create views for common queries (e.g., customer order history, product sales summary), explore view benefits in query simplification

---

### **Week 4: Stored Procedures & Functions with Focus on Automation**
**Day 1-2:** Introduction to Stored Procedures  
- **Practice:** Write procedures to automate repetitive tasks like updating stock, generating sales reports

**Day 3:** Functions in MySQL  
- **Practice:** Create reusable functions for calculating tax or discount; call them in other queries

**Day 4:** Triggers  
- **Practice:** Write triggers to automatically update stock quantity on purchase, or track changes in `orders` table

**Day 5:** Transactions & ACID Properties  
- **Practice:** Implement transactions for critical operations like order processing (place, cancel, update)

**Day 6-7:** Error Handling in SQL  
- **Practice:** Simulate errors and create error-handling mechanisms to manage exceptions in procedures

---

### **Week 5: Advanced Concepts & Security Focus**
**Day 1-2:** Advanced Indexing & Optimization  
- **Practice:** Experiment with different indexing methods on frequently joined tables, practice optimizing large datasets

**Day 3:** MySQL Constraints  
- **Practice:** Add constraints to enforce data integrity in `shop_db`, test edge cases (e.g., duplicate product IDs, missing data)

**Day 4:** Data Security & User Management  
- **Practice:** Set up multiple users with limited access, experiment with role-based permissions for `admin`, `manager`, `viewer`

**Day 5:** Backups & Recovery  
- **Practice:** Perform regular database backups with `mysqldump`, practice restoring a backup in a safe environment

**Day 6-7:** Working with JSON & Temporal Data  
- **Practice:** Store product details in JSON format, write queries for JSON fields; practice date functions with temporal data

---

### **Week 6: Practical Applications, Optimization, & Project Focus**
**Day 1-3:** Real-World Scenarios & Case Studies  
- **Focus:** Work on more complex scenarios, like multi-join reports, aggregations with conditions
- **Practice:** Case study: Build a small inventory management system using `shop_db`

**Day 4:** Review Core Concepts & Best Practices  
- **Practice:** Refactor queries to improve efficiency, revisit indexing, and normalization for optimization

**Day 5:** Advanced Performance Tuning  
- **Practice:** Use `EXPLAIN` on complex queries, review and optimize stored procedures and functions for performance

**Day 6-7:** Capstone Project  
- **Practice:** Create a capstone project, such as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, incorporating complex SQL operations, joins, and triggers
